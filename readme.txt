Telerobotics
Teleoperation means "doing work at a distance", although "work" may mean almost anything. The term "distance" is also vague: it can refer to a physical distance, where the operator is separated from the robot by a large distance, but it can also refer to a change in scale, where for example in robotic surgery a surgeon may use micro-manipulator technology to conduct surgery on a microscopic level.

There are two folders. Folder "prog" is made for Delphi7 code and sketch is for Arduino sketch. Have Fun!
